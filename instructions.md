### üßΩ **Printed Part Finishing (for Breathing Path)**

To ensure hygiene, airflow quality, and durability:

1. üî• **Deburr internal air paths**
   Use a lighter or mini butane torch to quickly pass over the interior surface for **1‚Äì2 seconds**.
   This melts loose strings and reduces fuzz.
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Keep the flame moving ‚Äî do not burn or deform the TPU.*

2. üñåÔ∏è **Seal with aquarium-safe silicone**
   Using a small brush or gloved finger, apply a **thin coat** of **aquarium-safe RTV silicone** (e.g. GE Silicone I, Dow 732) to:

   * The **entire internal breathing path**
   * Any **TPU joints that may flex under airflow**
   * Optionally, the **electronics PCB** to act as a conformal coating replacement

3. ‚è≥ **Let cure for 24 hours**
   Place parts in a well-ventilated area. Do **not** install or operate before fully cured.

### ‚úÖ Notes:

* This ensures **no stringing, no loose microplastics**, and a **cleanable, sterile inner wall**.
* RTV silicones are flexible and adhere to TPU well without cracking.
* Brushing it over the PCB is an effective conformal coating replacement, if avoiding spray-on types.
